#Project 3

This repo will be used to research and develop outlines for our project and house our code once we begin development. I think there is also a case to be made for using google drive documents as well.

## Introduction 
# Blockchain technology we can vastly improve transparency within crowdfunding for charitable or donatable causes. It is our goal for this project to create the groundwork for a freer and fairer platform to make safe and transparent contributions with your money. In our current reality, chunks of fundraised donations will be used to pay operating and processing fees for middlemen. We envision a way for donations raised to be invested directly to the causes that matter most to the people. Improving financing efficiencies whether it be for a charitable cause, aiding world disaster, alleviate global poverty, and much more. Blockchain records will securely keep public transactions made by the party recipient with the funds raised. Using smart contracts funds will only be used for the causes they contribute. By using blockchain, we work to help the many lowering transaction fees/Taxation fees when donating to a cause, develop Smart Contracts to enforce Funding Terms, and ensure less there is less money to middlemen and more money for the campaign.
