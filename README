#Project 3

This repo will be used to research and develop outlines for our project and house our code once we begin development. I think there is also a case to be made for using google drive documents as well.

## Introduction 
# Organizations such as charities raise money for a purpose but tracking their expenses is another story. Through Charitynavigator's API we were able to ingest data from thousands of IRS good standing organizations with its rankings based on a charity's financial health and the charity's Accountability & Transparency. What the database doesn't include is the thousands of organizations claiming to be a charity but is under investigation by the IRS. These organizations cause a lack of trust for donors, making fundraising so much harder for good standing charities.

# In our current reality, chunks of fundraised donations will be used to pay operating and processing fees for middlemen. We envision a way for donations raised to be invested directly to the causes that matter most to the people. Improving financing efficiencies whether it be for a charitable cause, aiding world disaster, alleviate global poverty, and much more. Blockchain records will securely keep public transactions made by the party recipient with the funds raised. Using smart contracts, funds will only be used for the causes they contribute. By using blockchain, we devise methods of lowering transaction & taxation fees when donating to a cause, develop smart contracts to enforce funding terms, and ensure less there is less money to middlemen and more money for the campaign. 

# Our solution to this problem, helping organizations gain trust with donors was to create a platform where a charity can create fundraising, clearly stating its intent and project scope, openly share the budget allocation including each recipient's wallet, create a crowdfunding campaign and deploy it. Our hope is to give more power to individuals donating by the ability to see where funding is spent, giving a more direct and personal connection via their contributions and the collective causes that matter the most to them.
